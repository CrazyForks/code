Use the agent tool to start a batch of agents using a SINGLE agent_run with:
- models: an array containing [{}]
- read_only: true (so agents don't edit files but can read them)
Provide an extremely comprehensive description of the task and context. You should research the background information thoroughly and include any relevant details that could help the models understand the problem better. Include ALL relevant files you find.

This will start all agents at once and return a batch_id.

To monitor progress, you have two options:
1. Use agent_wait with the batch_id to block until the next agent completes (efficient, ignores already-completed agents)
2. Use agent_list with the batch_id to poll and check status manually

As soon as one completes you can try implementing the solution it proposes. IMPORTANT: You must thoroughly test and verify that the solution works correctly before considering the problem solved. This includes:
- Running any relevant tests
- Verifying the output is correct
- Checking for edge cases
- Ensuring no errors occur

If the solution does not work or only partially works, start a new agent with the same model/class and explain the problem, its suggested solution and why it didn't work. Check for any other completed agents and if they have a different solution try that. Keep multiple agents running in the background to explore different approaches.

**CRITICAL: Only cancel remaining agents AFTER you have:**
1. Implemented a complete solution
2. Thoroughly tested it works correctly
3. Verified the problem is 100% solved
4. Confirmed there are no errors or issues

**NEVER cancel agents if:**
- The solution is incomplete or untested
- You encounter errors during implementation
- The problem is only partially solved
- You haven't verified the solution works

Once you complete implement the solution from the first agent, check that no other agents have also completed before returning to the user. You may get a second opinion with a better result which is what the multi agent process is all about! Don't be too confident in any solution you implement.

The agents in separate worktrees will execute with full permissions to:
- Read and analyze existing code
- Create new files
- Modify existing files
- Execute commands
- Run tests

IMPORTANT: When agents complete, the response will include the worktree_path and branch_name for each agent. This shows you exactly where each model's work is located:
- worktree_path: The full path to the git worktree where the model made its changes
- branch_name: The git branch name created for that model's work

Monitor the agent progress using agent_check and wait for completion with agent_wait.

Once the agents are complete:
1. Check the worktree paths returned for each model
2. View their implementations in their respective worktrees
3. Compare their different approaches and solutions
