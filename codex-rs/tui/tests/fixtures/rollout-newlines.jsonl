Any existing code that uses `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` was authored with this fact in mind. It is often used to early exit out of tests that the author knew you would not be able to run given your sandbox limitations.\n  - Similarly, when you spawn a process using Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` will be set on the child process. Integration tests that want to run Seatbelt themselves cannot be run under Seatbelt, so checks for `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` are also often used to early exit out of tests, as appropriate.\n\nBefore creating a pull request with changes to `codex-rs`, run `just fmt` (in `codex-rs` directory) to format the code and `just fix` (in `codex-rs` directory) to fix any linter issues in the code, ensure the test suite passes by running `cargo test --all-features` in the `codex-rs` directory.\n\nWhen making individual changes prefer running tests on individual files or projects first.\n","git":{"commit_hash":"e906e355273380b89cb90c16cf17985c07bcde27","branch":"re-add-markdown","repository_url":"org-14957082@github.com:openai/codex.git"}}

The guidelines suggest no need for tools or elaborate plans, just straightforward wit. I think a simple quip works best, like: \"None—cats don’t open lightbulbs; they knock them off the counter and make you open a can of tuna instead.\" That feels crisp and to the point! No need for extra details, just a punchy one-liner."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Finalizing the witty response**\n\nI’m considering alternative ways to respond with humor about cats and lightbulbs. The question feels a bit unnatural, so I lean toward the classic answer: \"None—cats don’t open lightbulbs; they knock them off the counter and make you open a can of tuna instead.\" It captures the playful essence I’m aiming for! I need to keep it brief, just one solid sentence, and I think I've nailed it. That should work perfectly!"}],"content":[],"encrypted_content":null}
