Please use gh to review all issues in https://github.com/just-every/code/issues/

1. Please assess if each issue is genuine and needs addressing
2. If it does need attention, work on a solution;
- Review the code to understand the issue
- Write tests to try to replicate the problem
- We may have already fixed the issue
- Any PRs created were performed by an automated build. They may resolve the issue, but don't assume that just because they exist the issue is resolved
- If we haven't fixed the issue and there's no automated PR which fixes it, then please write a fix in this branch
- Once complete, validate with build-fast.hs and commit the changes with commit message closing the issue, but don't push
3. Draft a response to the user based on findings above - if fixed, mention it will be out in next release. Don't suggest they build themselves. Save each draft response to a new file called issue-responses.md in the repo root so we can action later.
