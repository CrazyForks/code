## @just-every/code v0.2.138

This release improves spinner creation reliability by honoring session auth and avoiding unnecessary retries.

### Changes

- Auth: prevent background AuthManager resets and align request shape with harness to stop retry loops.
- Stability: reduce spinnerâ€‘creation failures by matching session auth preferences.
