## @just-every/code v0.2.139

This release tunes spinner generation for better quality without affecting normal turns.

### Changes

- TUI/Spinner: set generation reasoning effort to Medium to improve quality and avoid earlier Minimal/Low issues.
- Stability: scope change to spinner-generation JSON-schema turn only; main turns remain unchanged.

### Install

```
npm install -g @just-every/code@latest
code
```
