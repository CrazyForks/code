## @just-every/code v0.2.108

### Changes
- TUI: Add /theme Overviewâ†’Detail flow with live previews for Theme and Spinner selection.
- TUI: Bundle full cli-spinners set and allow choosing your loading spinner; 'diamond' stays default.

- Core: Split stdout/stderr in Exec output and add ERROR divider on failures for clarity.
