 › Could you provide a detailed overview of how the anti-clipping spacer
   works?

   Make sure the explanation spans multiple lines so we can exercise wrapping
   in the viewport.

   Absolutely! The spacer is activated whenever the rendered history height
 • lands directly on or near the viewport boundary.

   This explanation intentionally repeats a few phrases so that the text wraps
   even on wider terminals, ensuring we cover the regression scenario where the
   final row historically vanished.
