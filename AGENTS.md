# Rust/codex-rs

In the codex-rs folder where the rust code lives:

- Crate names are prefixed with `codex-`. For example, the `core` folder's crate is named `codex-core`
- When using format! and you can inline variables into {}, always do that.
- Never add or modify any code related to `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` or `CODEX_SANDBOX_ENV_VAR`.
  - You operate in a sandbox where `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` will be set whenever you use the `shell` tool. Any existing code that uses `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` was authored with this fact in mind. It is often used to early exit out of tests that the author knew you would not be able to run given your sandbox limitations.
  - Similarly, when you spawn a process using Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` will be set on the child process. Integration tests that want to run Seatbelt themselves cannot be run under Seatbelt, so checks for `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` are also often used to early exit out of tests, as appropriate.

Completion/build step

- Always validate using `./build-fast.sh` from the repo root. This is the single required check and must pass cleanly.
- Policy: All errors AND all warnings must be fixed before you’re done. Treat any compiler warning as a failure and address it (rename unused vars with `_`, remove `mut`, delete dead code, etc.).
- Do not run additional format/lint/test commands on completion (e.g., `just fmt`, `just fix`, `cargo test`) unless explicitly requested for a specific task.

When making individual changes prefer running tests on individual files or projects first if asked, but otherwise rely on `./build-fast.sh` at the end.

## Commit Messages

- Review staged changes before every commit: `git --no-pager diff --staged --stat` (and skim `git --no-pager diff --staged` if needed).
- Write a descriptive subject that explains what changed and why. Avoid placeholders like "chore: commit local work".
- Prefer Conventional Commits with an optional scope: `feat(tui/history): …`, `fix(core/exec): …`, `chore(docs): …`.
- Keep the subject ≤ 72 chars; add a short body if rationale or context helps future readers.
- Use imperative, present tense: "add", "fix", "update" (not "added", "fixes").
- For merge commits in the push flow, replace boilerplate with context, e.g.: `merge(main<-origin/main): adopt remote version bumps; keep ours for rust/*; resolve history_cell.rs conflict favoring new parser`.

Examples:

- `feat(tui/history): show exit code and duration for Exec cells`
- `fix(core/codex): handle SIGINT in on_exec_command_begin to avoid orphaned child`
- `chore(docs): clarify commit-message expectations in AGENTS.md`

## Git Push Policy (Do Not Rebase On Push Requests)

When the user asks you to "push" local work:

- Never rebase in this flow. Do not use `git pull --rebase` or attempt to replay local commits.
- Prefer a simple merge of `origin/main` into the current branch, keeping our local history intact.
- If the remote only has trivial release metadata changes (e.g., `codex-cli/package.json` version bumps), adopt the remote version for those files and keep ours for everything else unless the user specifies otherwise.
- If in doubt or if conflicts touch non-trivial areas, pause and ask before resolving.

Quick procedure (merge-only):

- `git fetch origin`
- `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/main` (stops before commit so you can choose file sides)
- Default to ours: `git checkout --ours .`
- Take remote for trivial package/version files as needed, e.g.: `git checkout --theirs codex-cli/package.json`
- `git add -A && git commit -m "merge(main<-origin/main): <brief description of conflict areas and resolution>"`
- Run `./build-fast.sh` and then `git push`

## Command Execution Architecture

The command execution flow in Codex follows an event-driven pattern:

1. **Core Layer** (`codex-core/src/codex.rs`):
   - `on_exec_command_begin()` initiates command execution
   - Creates `EventMsg::ExecCommandBegin` events with command details

2. **TUI Layer** (`codex-tui/src/chatwidget.rs`):
   - `handle_codex_event()` processes execution events
   - Manages `RunningCommand` state for active commands
   - Creates `HistoryCell::Exec` for UI rendering

3. **History Cell** (`codex-tui/src/history_cell.rs`):
   - `new_active_exec_command()` - Creates cell for running command
   - `new_completed_exec_command()` - Updates with final output
   - Handles syntax highlighting via `ParsedCommand`

This architecture separates concerns between execution logic (core), UI state management (chatwidget), and rendering (history_cell).

## Ephemeral Context Injection

Codex automatically injects fresh context at the end of each model request:

- **Location**: Ephemeral items are appended as the last items in the request via `get_formatted_input()`
- **Content**: System status (cwd, git branch, reasoning level), browser info (URL, type), screenshots
- **Generation**: `build_turn_ephemeral_items()` creates fresh context for each retry attempt
- **Storage**: Stored in `Prompt.ephemeral_items` field, ensuring they're regenerated per-request

This design ensures the model always receives current environment context without complex refresh logic or state management.
